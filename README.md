# EXAGE
Extensible and optimized game/graphics engine. 

EXAGE is an engine I started making last year. It contains a graphics abstraction layer and aims to be extremely performant and optimized while being flexible and intuitive. 

The main components are the windowing system, the low-level graphics abstraction (in Graphics), the high-level renderer, and some additional utilities involving entt and other libraries.
